Dunno why, but my thoughts drifted to
[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity) again today.
This absolutely drives me nuts and I struggle to understand how this can
possibly be. My immediate intuition is that if you freeze time across the
universe, then you should be able to see whether or not an event has happened
and there's no way that there can be ambiguity. Clearly that doesn't mesh with
it being relative. The other thing that drives me nuts is that the relativity of
simultaneity preserves causality for all observers. If, at the end of the
universe, everything were to collapse back into a singularity, wouldn't that
necessarily collapse this relativity back into strict time ordering, as all past
events would have had to cause the way in which the universe collapses?

This hurts my brain. Thank you _Hacker News_ for introducing me to this stupid
concept.
