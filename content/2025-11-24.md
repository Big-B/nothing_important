Transition from squarespace to cloudflare going to take 5 days. Will need to
move forward with blog on just localhost for now.

I also think that I need to look into using a subdomain to get access to my
jellyfin server. Something like jf.mittman.dev? Would be cool if I could also
get pihole available, but that'd require a static IP, and it looks like that
could cost around \$30/m from AT&T. Fuck that.
